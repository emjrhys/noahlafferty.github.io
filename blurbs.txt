Hello! I am a developer with a passion for web development, virtual reality, and game design. I'm currently looking for career opportunities in these and related areas.

While studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I interned at IBM Design, Amazon, and Pathfinder Software. Recently, I was part of a group that developed a way to test human perception of non-Euclidean geometries using virtual reality. I also created Hyperflora, an endless video playlist. You can read more about my work using the portfolio links below.

At the University of Illinois I was the lead web developer for HackIllinois, our premier hackathon, and Reflections | Projections, our annual student-run tech conference.

How do humans cognitively process non-standard geometries? Our team helped psychologists at the University of Illinois explore this question by building a simulation of hyperbolic geometry in VR. This began as a class project, and was voted the best of more than thirty VR projects.

With VR we have the ability to experience new environments in a way that was previously impossible. Using an HTC Vive, users can fly around several different types of geometric spaces, and experience the curvature of hyperbolic and spherical geometries. We developed a test plan to measure how accurately subjects can navigate these non-intuitive environments.

Hyperflora is a never-ending video experience inspired by Adult Swim’s Off the Air. Viewers can choose from several curated channels with specific themes like animation, music, or food. I built this site to gain familiarity with popular web technologies like Node.js and MongoDB. It was made in collaboration with Lisa Vuong.

During my senior year at the University of Illinois, I interned at IBM Design, as part of their Maelstrom program.

For our introductory project, we were tasked with redesigning the onboarding experience for new hires at IBM Design. We created a website to guide new employees through every step of the process, from receiving their offer letter to their first day of work.

We also worked with the Design Language team to research and design a system that would encourage a culture of critique within IBM Design. The goal was to help designers better understand and implement the tenants of the language. To do this, we proposed a website that would allow designers to explore and submit examples of the language as it was used in different contexts.

During my junior year at the University of Illinois, I served as web chair for our student-run tech conference, Reflections | Projections. This yearly event, hosted by the local chapter of the ACM since 1995, features tech talks from leaders in the industry and academia, together with career fairs and workshops. Recently, the conference was expanded to include an AI programming competition, a puzzle challenge, and even an escape room!

With a small team of developers, I designed and built the 2015 conference website. This was my first experience leading a team of developers.

HackIllinois, started in 2014, is an annual, student-run, 36 hour event where college students from across the country create technical projects ranging from websites and mobile apps to Wi-Fi connected microwaves.

I was lead web developer for the event in 2015. Our theme that year was arctic exploration, and our website encouraged visitors to “find their inner explorer.” Can you spot the hidden fish?

The following year, I built the signup page for the event, which featured a small game that visitors could play before registering.
