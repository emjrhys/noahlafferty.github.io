      <p>
        Hello! I am a developer with a passion for web development, virtual
        reality, and game design.  I'm currently looking for career
        opportunities in these and related areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        While studying <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">
          Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://illinois.edu/" target="_blank">
            University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, I interned at
        <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/" target="_blank">IBM Design</a>,
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, and
        <a href="http://orthogonal.io/" target="_blank">Pathfinder Software</a>.
        Recently, I was part of a group that developed a way to test human
        perception of <a href="#" class="portfolio-nav" data-section="non-euclidean">
          non-Euclidean geometries</a> using virtual reality. I also created
        <a href="#" class="portfolio-nav" data-section="hyperflora">Hyperflora</a>, an
        endless video playlist. You can read more about my work using the
        portfolio links below.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the University of Illinois I was the lead web developer for
        <a href="#" class="portfolio-nav" data-section="hackillinois">HackIllinois</a>,
        our premier hackathon, and <a href="https://reflectionsprojections.org/" target="_blank">
          Reflections | Projections</a>, our annual student-run tech conference.

      <h2>Non-Euclidean Spaces</h2>
      <p>
        How do humans cognitively process non-standard geometries?  Our team
        helped psychologists at the University of Illinois explore this
        question by building a simulation of hyperbolic geometry in VR. This
        began as a class project, and was voted the best of more than thirty
        VR projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        With VR we have the ability to experience new environments in a way
        that was previously impossible. Using an HTC Vive, users can fly
        around several different types of geometric spaces, and experience
        the curvature of hyperbolic and spherical geometries. We developed a
        test plan to measure how accurately subjects can navigate these
        non-intuitive environments.

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.hyperflora.tv/" target="_blank">Hyperflora</a> is a
        never-ending video experience inspired by
        <a href="http://www.adultswim.com/videos/off-the-air/" target="_blank">
          Adult Swim’s <i>Off the Air</i></a>. Viewers can choose from several
        curated channels with a specific theme like animation, music, or food.
        I built this site to gain familiarity with popular web technologies like
        <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and
        <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>. It was

      <h2>IBM Design | Maelstrom</h2>
      <p>
        During my senior year, I interned at
        <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/" target="_blank">IBM Design</a>, as part of their
        <a href="https://medium.com/design-ibm/i-live-to-tell-the-tale-the-ibm-maelstrom-experience-cf38ec57e439" target="_blank">Maelstrom</a> program.
      </p>
      <p>
        For our introductory project, we were tasked with redesigning the
        onboarding experience for new hires at IBM Design. We created a
        website that guides new employees through every step of the process,
        from receiving their offer letter to their first day of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        We worked with the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/language/" target="_blank">
          Design Language</a> team to research and design a system that would
        encourage a culture of critique within IBM Design. The goal was to help
        designers better understand and implement the tenants of the language.
        To do this, we proposed a website that would allow designers to explore
        and submit examples of the language as it was used in different contexts.

      <h2>Reflections | Projections 2015</h2>
      <p>
        During my junior year, I served as web chair for our student-run
        tech conference, <a href="https://reflectionsprojections.org/#/" target="_blank">
          Reflections | Projections</a>. This yearly event, hosted by the local
        chapter of the <a href="https://www.acm.org/" target="_blank">ACM</a>
        since 1995, features tech talks from leaders in the industry and academia,
        together with career fairs and workshops. Recently, the conference was
        expanded to include an AI programming competition, a puzzle challenge,
        and even an escape room!
      </p>
      <p>
        With a small team of developers, I designed and built the
        <a href="https://www-s.acm.illinois.edu/conference/2015/" target="_blank">
          2015 conference website</a>. This was my first experience leading a
          team of developers.

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.hackillinois.org/" target="_blank">HackIllinois</a>, started in 2014, is an annual, student-run, 36 hour
        event where college students from across the country create technical
        projects ranging from websites and mobile apps to Wi-Fi connected
        microwaves.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was lead web developer for the event in 2015. Our theme that year
        was arctic exploration, and
        <a href="http://2015.hackillinois.org/" target="_blank">our website</a>
        encouraged visitors to “find their inner explorer.” Can you spot the
        hidden fish?
      </p>
      <p>
        The following year, I built the <a href="#" target="_blank">signup page</a> for the conference, which
        featured a small game that visitors could play before registering.
